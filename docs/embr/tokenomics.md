# Initial Supply 

The initial mint will be 22% of the maximium supply and will be broken down as follows:

<center>

| Allocation        | % of Supply                          |  Amount Of Tokens |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool |  2.0%  | 500,000 |
| Vested Team Funds       | 15% | 3,750,000 |
| Strategic Partnerships   | 5%    | 1,250,000

</center>

Note: Of the 22% minted, only 2.65% will be in circulation upon launch, all other tokens will follow the vesting schedules described below

# Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LPB)

The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool will use the allocated 2% of the Total Max Supply of EMBR (500,000 EMBR) and $43,000 worth of USDC.

* 500k EMR tokens will be distributed using a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP). The exact date and time will be announced.
* The LBP will run for 24 hours and is open to anyone.
* The LBP is not like a regular weighted pool. The price will start very high to disincentivize bots, front-running and speculation. Over time, the price will automatically decrease by design.
* Below is a graph that shows the EMBR/USDC pool weight starting at 95/5 (with a high EMBR price) and declining to 80/20 (lower EMBR price) over 24 hours.
* At the end of the 24 hour period, the funds will be transferred from the LBP into an 80/20 EMBR/USDC weighted pool.
* The LP tokens received by the development team for making the initial pool will deposited into the EMBR/USDC.
* **NOTE**: the graph below assumes no buy/sell orders, the price will very likely fluctuate at variance with the below model as we expect buying pressure to occur. The models below are only an illustration of the basic operation of the LBP function.

# Vested Team Funds

The team funds will be vested linearly and will be  distributed according to the following schedule:

* 10 % Initial Allowance  ( 375,000 )
* 90 % Vested Lineraly over 4 years ( 3,375,000 )

None of the initially unlocked allowance will be used in the EMBR/USDC farm. Both the team wallet and vesting contract will be made available in the documentation

# Strategic Partnerships

This fund will be deployed to attract and incentivize strategic partners that will help Embr grow and thrive. 5% of the total maximum supply will be reserved to promote ecosystem partnerships. 

Embr finance will never use any of the funds in the Strategic Partnerships Fund to pay or reward any of its team members or employees. This fund is exclusively for partners, integrators and other teams in general that contribute to the Embr ecosystem. Any use of these funds will be presented to the community prior to execution.

# Token Emissions

After the initial mint, the remaining supply will be emitted over 4 years, following our [Token Emissions](/embr/token-emissions/). The emissions will be distributed as follows:

| Allocation        | % of Supply                          | 
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | 
| LP Farm Rewards |  68.0%  |
| Treasury Funds | 10.0% |

See the [Token Emissions](/embr/token-emissions/) section for more details.
