# Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LPB)

The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool will use the allocated 2% of the Total Max Supply of EMBR (500,000 EMBR) and $44,500 USD worth of AUSD.

* 500k EMR tokens will be distributed using a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP). The exact date and time will be announced.
* The LBP will run for 24 hours and is open to anyone.
* The LBP is not like a regular weighted pool. The price will start very high to disincentivize bots, front-running and speculation. Over time, the price will automatically decrease by design.
* Below is a graph that shows the EMBR/AUSD pool weight starting at 95/5 (with a high EMBR price) and declining to 80/20 (lower EMBR price) over 24 hours.
* At the end of the 24 hour period, the funds will be transferred from the LBP into an 80/20 EMBR/AUSD weighted pool.
* The LP tokens received by the development team for making the initial pool will deposited into the EMBR/AUSD.
* **NOTE**: the graph below assumes no buy/sell orders, the price will very likely fluctuate at variance with the below model as we expect buying pressure to occur. The models below are only an illustration of the basic operation of the LBP function.
