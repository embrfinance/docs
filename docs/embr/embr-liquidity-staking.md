# EMBR Liquidity Staking

* We will incentivize 80/20 EMBR pools with farming rewards to promote deep liquidity for the EMBR token.
* Liquidity Providers (LPs) are exposed to minimal Impermanent Loss in an 80/20 weighted pool.
* In the near future, an undecided % of protocol fees will be distributed to Liquidity Stakers in the 80/20 EMBR/WAVAX pool.


# 80/20 EMBR Incentivized Pools

The primary source of initial liquidity for the EMBR token will be the 80/20 EMBR pools hosted on Embr Finance. To incentivize deep liquidity for these pools, we will be allocating them the largest multiplier across all available farms. 


# Protocol Fee Distribution

In the near future, a percentage of protocol fees will be redistributed to the EMBR lp. This happens by means of a SushiBar (xSUSHI) variation. Liquidity providers’ of 80/20 EMBR/WAVAX will be able to stake their LP tokens and receive “cEmbr” (or “charred Embr”) these represent your LP position, which will grow over time the longer you stay in the pool. A new farm will be created for cEmbr and emissions of the current EMBR/WAVAX farm will be redirected to this new farm. Once a week, the protocol fees are collected and percentage wil be put into the EMBR/WAVAX pool. The received LP tokens will then be transferred into the 80/20 EMBR/WAVAX pool (the SushiBar) increasing the value of the cEmbr token. 

The characteristics and benefits of the 80/20 weighted pool will allow us to forgo any single staking pools for the EMBR token.
