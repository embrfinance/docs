# Token Emissions

Minting EMBR
We utilize MasterChef for minting and distribution of new EMBR tokens. The MasterChef contract is the owner of the EMBR token. See the owner section on the EMBR contract.

This means only the MasterChef has the permission to mint new EMBR tokens. There is no way to transfer ownership of the EMBR token from the MasterChef. 

# Distrubution

The reminaing 78% of the total supply will be minted over 4 years following the Emission Schedule. The emissions will be distributed as follows:

<center>

| LP Farm Rewards | 68%  |  17,000,000 |
| Treasury Funds | 10%  |  2,500,000 |

# Emmission Schedule 

TBD. Current schedule based on EMBR / block but is being reworked to emit over time to account for avalanches variable block times.
