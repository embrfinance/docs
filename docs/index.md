## **Features**

#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Weighted Investment Pools
Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset. 

#### :dollar: Stable Pools
For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

#### :left_right_arrow: Trade
Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

#### :tractor: Farm
Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

#### :money_with_wings: Earn Protocol Fees
Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).
